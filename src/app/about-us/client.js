          Our wish to have everything in one place, came into existence through{" "}
          <br /> phones and apps, and now imagine, all of it is a tap awayâ€¦.

          contacts, and business <br /> profile with just a tap and a little bit
          of consent. As someone once said, <br /> your network is your net
          worth, Myda is the medium that makes it <br /> happen with just a tap
          away. It simplifies networking, makes it more <br /> efficient, and
          does it at a light's speed. The introvert in you won't shy <br />{" "}
          away, and the extrovert in you will be limitless.

          <br />
          Myda is a tech based startup which simplifies networking with just a{" "}
          <br /> tap. Easy to connect, install, share and network. Makes life
          easier and its <br /> cool too. Myda is an acronym to My Digital Asset
          that took us 15 days or <br /> so to finalize and yes it was over a
          few friendly drinks and banter. Our <br /> core team comprises four
          childhood hostel friends that decided to <br /> revolutionise the
          world of networking and connections. Shubham Keyal- <br /> who handles
          our tech and is the brain behind the Myda, Kaustubh <br /> Chaturvedi-
          who handles operations and knows how to get the work <br /> done
          silently, Adesh- our legal backbone and the one who not just <br />{" "}
          handles account but makes sure we spend wisely and lastly Pranjal-{" "}
          <br /> who handles sales and marketing, and makes sure we work as hard
          as <br /> he parties. We in all sincerity aim to grow and reach a
          wider audience. <br /> Our focus is and shall remain on basic
          fundamentals of what we <br /> decided to stand for and that is making
          connections in today's day and age easy, cool and <br /> simplified.
